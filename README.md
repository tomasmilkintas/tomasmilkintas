been using thus far:
    - HTML / CSS / ES6 JavaScript
    - ReactJS / React Hookes
    - Redux
    - Webpack
    - MongoDB
    - ExpressJs
    - NodeJs
    - Git
    - AWS (IAM, Cognito, S3, Route53, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, API Gateway)
    - Firebase
    - Storybook
    - Figma
    - Stripe

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- How to utilize AWS with the Serverless Framework properly. Having completed the tutorial
project setting up both backend and frontend, it is time to get my hands dirty.
